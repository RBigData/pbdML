\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual
\texttt{install.packages()}:

\begin{lstlisting}
install.packages("pbdML")
\end{lstlisting}

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be
installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

\begin{lstlisting}
### Pick your preference
devtools::install_github("RBigData/pbdML")
ghit::install_github("RBigData/pbdML")
remotes::install_github("RBigData/pbdML")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Randomized SVD/PCA}\label{randomized-svdpca}

The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization, with
numerous applications {[}@TODO{]}.

\[
A = U \Sigma V^T
\]

An application of the SVD well-known to stasticians is principal
components analysis (PCA) \cite{rencher}.

A common technique is to compute the first 2 or 3 principal components
in order to visualize high-dimensional data.

Estimation \cite{halko2011finding}

To show how this works, we generate a \(30000\times 5000\) matrix with 3
different separate clusters:

\begin{lstlisting}
gen <- function(m, n, mean, sd) matrix(rnorm(m*n, mean, sd), m, n)

m <- 10000
n <- 5000
sd <- 10

x1 <- gen(m, n, 0, sd)
x2 <- gen(m, n, 4, sd)
x3 <- gen(m, n, -2, sd)

x <- rbind(x1, x2, x3)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
library(pbdML)
system.time({
  pc <- rpca(x, k=2)
})
##  user  system elapsed 
## 8.908   4.028  11.674 
\end{lstlisting}

Compare this to the full PCA computation:

\begin{lstlisting}
system.time({
  pc.full <- prcomp(x)
})
##    user  system elapsed 
## 644.632 159.220 240.094 
\end{lstlisting}

The size comparisons are even more striking:

\begin{lstlisting}
library(memuse)

memuse(x)
## 1.118 GiB
memuse(pc)
## 548.773 KiB
memuse(pc.full)
## 1.304 GiB
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
plot(pc$x[, 1], pc$x[, 2])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Decomp/Recomp}\label{decomprecomp}

One day on Twitter, someone asked a very interesting question:

After some requests for clarification, the problem was stated as
follows:

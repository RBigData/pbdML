Title: Programming with Big Data -- Machine Learning
Version: 0.1-1
Description: A collection of machine learning utilities that can
    be run either in serial with native R objects (matrices and vectors)
    or in parallel with distributed matrices from the 'pbdDMAT' package.
    Here, we focus on ease of coding and understanding rather than
    performance (i.e., all code is written in R), and as such this
    package should primarily be thought of as a demonstration of the
    capabilities of the 'pbdDMAT' package.
